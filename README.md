# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content. It demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms can be applied to detect unwanted or potentially harmful messages.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data preprocessing and text cleaning  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Predictive system for new email input  
- Accuracy and performance metrics included

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full code and explanations
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions (this file)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Tokenize and vectorize the email text using TF-IDF  
3. Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression)  
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.  
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new email samples

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file  
2. Install required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
   ```
3. Open the notebook with Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning.ipynb"
   ```
4. Run each cell sequentially to see the workflow and results

## 📈 Results

- Achieved a high accuracy score on the test data  
- The model is able to classify new email messages as spam or not spam

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Use more advanced models like Random Forest or deep learning  
- Build a simple web interface for real-time predictions  
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset for training
